## CS lab macs

This installation is in progress, and this section will be updated
with instructions when it is ready.

### Remote access to the CS lab Macs

Information forthcoming.

## ITS general-access Windows PCs

**This installation is in progress, and will not work yet.  This
section will be updated with additional details when everything is
working.**

To launch an Agda-aware Emacs, look for "Emacs for Agda" in the
Windows start menu (lower-left corner) of applications.

 - You must still configure Agda's localization files to point it to
   the standard libraries, Step 2 of section *Installing the Agda
   standard libraries* on the [Getting started]({{ site.baseurl
   }}/Setup/) page.

   On the ITS PCs, the Agda standard library is
   located at `C:\Program Files\Agda\stdlib`, so the file reference
   for the standard library from the `.agda/libraries` file should be
   to `C:\Program Files\Agda\stdlib\standard-library.agda-lib`.

 - Your local Agda files --- such as your local copy (copies) of the
   Course Pack --- should go within the
   `C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\Documents` directories, replacing
   `YOURACCOUNT` with your Windows user ID.

### Access to ITS Windows PCs via the remote desktop

Remote desktop information forthcoming.
